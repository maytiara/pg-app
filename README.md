<summary>Hello World üöÄ</summary>

- This past 6 months was been a rollercoaster journey, I didn't think of myself that I will be able to build something different out of my comfort zone. An awesome learning experience, with frustrations and some continuous graveyard shifts just to code and learn through applying what I've learned.

If you want to keep in touch and fork my private gourmet app, I'm grateful to collaborate and learn from your expertise. 

Hello World! My friend üöÄ
